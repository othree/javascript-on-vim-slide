 * :help 44.12

 Choose a good, descriptive name for your syntax file.  Use lowercase letters
 and digits.  Don't make it too long, it is used in many places: The name of
 the syntax file "name.vim", 'filetype', b:current_syntax and the start of each
 syntax group (nameType, nameStatement, nameString, etc).
