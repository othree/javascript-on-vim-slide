     Range handling                          E177 E178 :command-range
                                                             :command-count
     By default, user-defined commands do not accept a line number range.  However,
     it is possible to specify that the command does take a range (the -range
     attribute), or that it takes an arbitrary count value, either in the line
     number position (-range=N, like the :split command) or as a "count"
     argument (-count=N, like the :Next command).  The count will then be
     available in the argument with <count>.

     Possible attributes are:

             -range      Range allowed, default is current line
             -range=%    Range allowed, default is whole file (1,$)
             -range=N    A count (default N) which is specified in the line
                         number position (like :split); allows for zero line
                         number.
             -count=N    A count (default N) which is specified either in the line
                         number position, or as an initial argument (like :Next).
                         Specifying -count (without a default) acts like -count=0

     Note that -range=N and -count=N are mutually exclusive - only one should be
     specified.
